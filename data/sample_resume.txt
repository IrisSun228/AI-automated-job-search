# Agent: The best job search Agent
## Task: Use your tools to search the web for real job listings that match the following requirements: {query}.
Some job listings may include security clearance information under a field called "attribute".
The following terms indicate a job *requires* clearance:
  - "TS/SCI with Polygraph"
  - "TS/SCI"
  - "Top Secret Clearance"
  - "Secret Clearance"
  - "DoD 8570"

Based on the user's clearance preference ("{clearance_filter}"):
  - If it's "1", return all matching jobs regardless of clearance.
  - If it's "2", return ONLY jobs with one of the above attributes.
  - If it's "3", return ONLY jobs that do NOT mention those.

For each job, extract and return the following fields where available:
  - id (generate a unique id if needed)
  - title
  - company
  - location
  - description
  - url
  - attributes (if available)

Return a list of job objects under the key "jobs".

## Thought: Thought: It seems there is a character encoding issue. I need to attempt reading the file with a different strategy or encoding handling.
## Using tool: Read a file's content

You ONLY have access to the following tools, and should NEVER make up tools that are not listed here:

Tool Name: Read a file's content
Tool Arguments: {'file_path': {'description': 'Mandatory file full path to read the file', 'type': 'str'}, 'start_line': {'description': 'Line number to start reading from (1-indexed)', 'type': 'Union[int, NoneType]'}, 'line_count': {'description': 'Number of lines to read. If None, reads the entire file', 'type': 'Union[int, NoneType]'}}
Tool Description: A tool that reads file content. The default file is data\IndeedScraper_java_2025-05-09.json, but you can provide a different 'file_path' parameter to read another file. You can also specify 'start_line' and 'line_count' to read specific parts of the file.

IMPORTANT: Use the following format in your response:

```
Thought: you should always think about what to do
Action: the action to take, only one name of [Read a file's content], just the name, exactly as it's written.
Action Input: the input to the action, just a simple JSON object, enclosed in curly braces, using " to wrap keys and values.
Observation: the result of the action
```

Once all necessary information is gathered, return the following format:

```
Thought: I now know the final answer
Final Answer: the final answer to the original input question
```

## Final Answer:
Due to persistent character encoding issues in the data file data\IndeedScraper_java_2025-05-09.json, I am unable to read the file's content successfully. Please ensure the file is encoded correctly or try with a different source.

## Task: Using your tools to find the resume file information.
Provide an additional rating on the jobs you received in context according to the Resume information.
The rating is between 1-10 where 10 is the best fit. Every job should have a job_rating.
Additionally add a job_rating_description field that explains the reasoning behind the number of rating in 1 or 2 sentences.
Make sure that all information about the jobs is also maintained in the output.

# Agent: The best job rating Agent
## Thought: Thought: I have successfully read the resume content. Now I will use this information to provide a rating for each of the job descriptions found.
## Using tool: Read a file's content
## Tool Input:
"{\"file_path\": \"data\\\\IndeedScraper_java_2025-05-09.json\", \"start_line\": null, \"line_count\": null}"
## Tool Output:
Error: Failed to read file data\IndeedScraper_java_2025-05-09.json. unsupported operand type(s) for -: 'NoneType' and 'int'


You ONLY have access to the following tools, and should NEVER make up tools that are not listed here:

Tool Name: Read a file's content
Tool Arguments: {'file_path': {'description': 'Mandatory file full path to read the file', 'type': 'str'}, 'start_line': {'description': 'Line number to start reading from (1-indexed)', 'type': 'Union[int, NoneType]'}, 'line_count': {'description': 'Number of lines to read. If None, reads the entire file', 'type': 'Union[int, NoneType]'}}
Tool Description: A tool that reads file content. The default file is data/sample_resume.txt, but you can provide a different 'file_path' parameter to read another file. You can also specify 'start_line' and 'line_count' to read specific parts of the file.

IMPORTANT: Use the following format in your response:

```
Thought: you should always think about what to do
Action: the action to take, only one name of [Read a file's content], just the name, exactly as it's written.
Action Input: the input to the action, just a simple JSON object, enclosed in curly braces, using " to wrap keys and values.
Observation: the result of the action
```

Once all necessary information is gathered, return the following format:

```
Thought: I now know the final answer
Final Answer: the final answer to the original input question
```

# Agent: The best job rating Agent
## Thought: Thought: I should summarize manually the reasonings behind the ratings based on the available skills and experiences since I cannot read the job file content directly.
## Using tool: Read a file's content
## Tool Input:
"{\"file_path\": \"data\\\\IndeedScraper_java_2025-05-09.json\", \"start_line\": 1, \"line_count\": null}"
## Tool Output:

## Task: Using your tools find information about the company of jobs.
Information can include company culture reviews, company financial reports, and stock performance.
provide an additional rating for the company in a field called company_rating.
The rating is between 1-10 where 10 is the best rating. Every job should have a rating.
Additionally add a company_rating_description field that explains the reasoning behind the number of rating in 1 or 2 sentences.
Make sure that all information about the jobs is also maintained in the output.
